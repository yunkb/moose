# Self-stabilized Non-ordinary State-based Peridynamic Generalized Plane Strain Off-diagonal Kernel

## Description

Kernel `GeneralizedPlaneStrainOffDiagNOSPD` provides the off-diagonal coupling entries to coupled scalar out-of-plane strain variable with displacement and temperature variables for self-stabilized non-ordinary state-based peridynamic models. This kernel is optional for generalized plane strain model, but is usually used for better convergence rate of the solution process.
