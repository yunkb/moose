# Peridynamic Mechanics Action

## Description

Action `MechanicsActionPD` can be used to setup the Kernel for each component of displacements, the UserObject `GhostElemPD` to ghost connected solutions from other processors due to nonlocality, the quadrature rule to `FIRST` order `GAUSS_LOBATTO` family, and AuxVariable `bond_status` for peridynamic mechanics models. More details about this action can be found at the [MechanicsActionPD](Peridynamics/Mechanics/index.md) system page.
